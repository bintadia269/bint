          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
          where
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly

            " I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've
            been
            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had 
            an
            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free into course
            and 
            found it incredbly fun! I enrolled shortly there after.The next
            12
            weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing thr course, I've successfully switched careers,
            working as
            a Sofware Engineer at a VR starsup"

                        "Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I needed some struture from
                        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a 
                        former student of their who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire 
                        curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for 
                        assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next 
                        level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In I've often referred to it during interviews as 
                        an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer 
                        after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
